# Custom Template for unRaid
unRaid custom template for orginal Teamspeak docker image

I'm not a developer, the file was to learn how to work with dockerman.

If you want to use the template put the file in '/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/'
Give the file root permissions, add docker an choose from the drop down list.
