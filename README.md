# Custom Template for unRaid
unRaid custom template for orginal Teamspeak docker image

I'm not a developer, the file was to learn how to work with dockerman.

If you want to use the template give the file root permissions and put the file in ```/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/```,<Br>add docker an choose from the drop down list ```teamSpeak-officialdocker```. Set ```AppData``` folder and ```accept``` the licence
