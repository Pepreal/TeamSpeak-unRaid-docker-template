# Custom Template for unRaid
unRaid custom template for orginal Teamspeak docker image

I'm not a developer, the file was to learn how to work with dockerman.

If you want to use the template ```mkdir -p /boot/config/plugins/community.applications/private/myrepo
cp teamSpeak-officialdocker.xml /boot/config/plugins/community.applications/private/myrepo```<br>
Go to the Community Apps tab (assuming its installed) go to private apps on the left, and install from there.<br>
Set ```AppData``` folder and ```accept``` the licence
